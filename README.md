# GeneHummus

An Automated Pipeline to Classify Gene Families based on Protein Domain Organization using Auxin Response Factors in **chickpea** and other Legumes as an Example

## Workflow

![](workflow.png)


In total, we have identified **350 Auxin Response Factor protein** sequences across **10 different Legume species**. 

| Species  | # ARF |
|---------|----------------|
| *Glycine max* | 61     |
| *Lupinus angustifolius* | 49 |
| *Arachis ipaensis* | 41
| *Arachis duranensis* | 39
| *Cajanus cajan* |  33
| *Vigna angularis* | 30
| *Vigna radiata* | 29
| *Cicer arietinum* | 24
| *Medicago truncatula* | 23 
| *Phaseolus vulgaris* | 21


* What does this information tell us about the expansion of the ARF in Legumes? -in terms of gene duplications (early/ancestral)-  


## Phylogeny  

![](PhyloIO_Tree.svg)

* How many sister pairs are between two different species?   
* How many sister pairs are between the same species?   
* Proteins belonging the same group within a species, do they locate on the same chromosome?  
* Ancestral Proteins were Present in the Last common ancestor before the species diverged from each other.   
* Single Exception: A XXX subclass with no homology to any other legume.   


Should we expect the **same evolutionary history with other gene family**? For example, resistance-like genes? Shouldn't we expect more species-specific clades meaning the certains challenges that each species has met during its evolutionary development?
