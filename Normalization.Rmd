### Read object 
```{r}
load("./my_SRA.RData")
```

### Check df
```{r}
head(df2, 10)
```


### Normalization
```{r}
df2$norm_Moamen=df2$Count*mean(df2$MbRun)/df2$MbRun
df2$norm_Jose=df2$Count/df2$MbRun*df2$Ref_Total
head(df2,7)
```
We can compare expression levels (based on counts) of a given ARF sequence across the libraries. 

```{r}
df3 = df2[df2$Reference == "LOC101489666",]
plot(df3$norm_Moamen, df3$norm_Jose, pch = 19, type = "l", col = "red")
```
